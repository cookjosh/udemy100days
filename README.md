# Udemy 100 Days of Code - Python

## Overview
My repo for [Udemy 100 Days of Code Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu. I am working through this course to get additional practice and knowledge in Python, as well as begin building a portfolio of projects. I look forward to any suggestions, comments, edits, etc... :).



- Days 1-10: In this subdir, most of these exercises and projects are recorded a) to show my take on some of the solutions but also b) to practice working with branching, merging, etc...
- Days 11-20: Capsulation of Beginner-level lessons and basic script-style programs. Moves in to Intermediate-level lessons and an introduction to OOP, classes, objects, etc...
