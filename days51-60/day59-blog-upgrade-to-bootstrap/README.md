# Day 59 - Personal Blog Project
## Combo of Flask, Boostrap, and Jinja

Uses JSON bin at [this free endpoint creation site](https://www.npoint.io/) and sample json text provided in the course to create the blog posts.

Python `requests` pulls json data from that endpoint and Jinja templating creates a `for` loop and variables to be used throughout the project.
